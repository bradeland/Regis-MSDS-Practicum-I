Using Intermarket Analysis to try to predict a stock
MSDS692: Data Science Practicum

Purpose:
I want to use intermarket analysis to try to predict the price of one stock based on data and correlations within other stocks.  The current way people many people try to predict a stock is based on looking at one stock and maybe trying to base the price movement on a previous open/close/high/low.  They may only look at one chart as shown below:

Intermarket analysis and machine learning can take more data and process it more quickly.  Machine learning can also help to take some of the human emotion out of the equation.  You can take the above chart and turn it into this:

Running the program in pycharm:
I used the Pycharm community 2023.1 edition which was robust enough for this modeling. 
I am including a requirements.txt file.  You will need to run this in your python console.
You will need to make sure the applicable libraries have been installed either via import (if you already have them installed).  Some are already native to pycharm/python while others may need to be added within the pycharm interpreter.  
pip install -r requirements.txt
If youâ€™re unable to run anything or get an error, you can manually download anything under my library section within the script by going to the following location within Pycharm (screenshot shown below):

File-->Settings-->Python Interpreter-->Click the + and search for the library-->Install Package
